## Visual Studio Code Dev Containers (1.10.x only)
A devcontainer file is provided to give quick access to the examples.

The main configuration points to the 1.10.5 version image, if you want to use the development image just change the __image__ property in _.devcontainer/devcontainer.json_ (as in _edge-devcontainer.json_).

To open the development container just move to the _v1.10.x_ directory, open VS Code, type __CTRL+Shift+P__ and select "Remote Containers: Reopen in Container".
