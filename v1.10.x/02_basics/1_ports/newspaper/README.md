Here we discuss a simple example where both OneWay/Notification and RequestResponse/SolicitResponse primitives are used. The complete code can be checked and downloaded at this [link](https://github.com/jolie/examples/tree/master/v1.10.x/02_basics/1_ports/newspaper).

The example's architecture is reported below.

![](https://docs.jolie-lang.org/v1.10.x/.gitbook/assets/newspaper.png)

A newspaper service collects news sent by authors, users can get all the registered news into the newspaper. The interface of the newspaper service defines two operations:

* _sendNews_ which is a OneWay operation used by authors for sending news to the newspaper service
* _getNews_ which is a RequestResponse operation used by users for getting the list of the registered news

```jolie
type News: void {
    .category: string
    .title: string
    .text: string
    .author: string
}

type GetNewsResponse: void {
    .news*: News
}

type SendNewsRequest: News

interface NewsPaperInterface {
  RequestResponse:
      getNews( void )( GetNewsResponse )

  OneWay:
      sendNews( SendNewsRequest )
}
```

The implementation of the two operations is very simple; we exploit a global variable for storing all the incoming news. When the _getNews_ is invoked, we just return the list of the stored news. Details about the global variables can be found in section [Processes](../processes.md).

```jolie
from NewsPaperInterface import NewsPaperInterface


service NewsPaper {
  execution: concurrent 

  inputPort NewsPaperPort {
    location:"auto:ini:/Locations/NewsPaperPort:file:locations.ini"
    protocol: sodep
    interfaces: NewsPaperInterface
  }

  main {
      [ getNews( request )( response ) {
          response.news -> global.news
      }]

      [ sendNews( request ) ] { global.news[ #global.news ] << request }
  }
}
```

The author and the user can invoke the _NewsPaper_ by exploiting two jolie scripts, _author.ol_ and _user.ol_ respectively. The two scripts can be run in a separate shell with respect to the newspaper one. In the following we report the code of the twi scripts:

```jolie
//author.ol
from NewsPaperInterface import NewsPaperInterface
from console import Console
from console import ConsoleInputInterface

service AuthorClient {

  embed Console as Console

  inputPort ConsoleInput {
    location: "local"
    Interfaces: ConsoleInputInterface
  }

  outputPort NewsPaper {
    location: "socket://localhost:9000"
    protocol: sodep
    interfaces: NewsPaperInterface
  }

  main {
      /* in order to get parameters from the console we need to register the service to the console one
      by using the operatio registerForInput. After this, we are enabled to receive messages from the console
      on input operation in (defined in console.iol)*/
      registerForInput@Console()();
      print@Console("Insert category:")(); in( request.category );
      print@Console("Insert title:")(); in( request.title );
      print@Console("Insert news text:")(); in( request.text );
      print@Console("Insert your name:")(); in( request.author );
      sendNews@NewsPaper( request );
      println@Console("The news has been sent to the newspaper")()
  }
}
```

```jolie
//user.ol
from NewsPaperInterface import NewsPaperInterface
from console import Console


service UserClient {

  embed Console as Console
  outputPort NewsPaper {
    location: "socket://localhost:9000"
    protocol: sodep
    interfaces: NewsPaperInterface
  }

  main {
      getNews@NewsPaper()( response );
      for( i = 0, i < #response.news, i++ ) {
          println@Console( "CATEGORY: " + response.news[ i ].category )();
          println@Console( "TITLE: " + response.news[ i ].title )();
          println@Console( "TEXT: " + response.news[ i ].text )();
          println@Console( "AUTHOR: " + response.news[ i ].author )();
          println@Console("------------------------------------------")()
      }
  }
}

```
