This directory contains the following content:
- jolie-bin: a binary distribution of the JOLIE interpreter;
- jolie: a Unix/Linux/MacOSX launcher for executing the example;
- jolie.bat: a Windows launcher for executing the example;
- the JOLIE code for the smart aggregation example.

The source code of the updated version of the JOLIE interpreter can be downloaded
from the JOLIE source code Subversion repository, see:
http://www.jolie-lang.org/source_code.php

Before starting the example, be sure that the following TCP ports are not used by other applications:
9000, 9001, 9002, 9003, 9009

To start the example, launch the following commands (in order) in separate shells.
The presence of Java version 1.6 (or Java6) is required.
Use the jolie launcher if you are under a *nix system (e.g., Linux and MacOS X), or jolie.bat if you are under a Windows system.

- jolie printer1.ol
- jolie printer2.ol
- jolie fax.ol
- jolie logger.ol
- jolie aggregator.ol
- jolie client.ol

The services will interact and each one will print some logging messages on screen.
The smart aggregator will redirect the client's requests to the appropriate printer or fax.
The last request from the client has an invalid key, and will be rejected.
