# Example of Aggregation with a simple courier

To start the example, launch the following commands (in order) in separate shells.

- jolie printer.ol
- jolie fax.ol
- jolie aggregator.ol
- jolie logger.ol
- jolie authenticator.ol
- jolie client.ol

Note that the service logger.ol just logs all the calls directed to the aggregated ports Printer and Fax
in the Aggregator.
