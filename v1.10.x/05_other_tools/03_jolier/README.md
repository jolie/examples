# jolier usage example
In this example it is possible to experiment how `jolier` works.
Here there is a target service called `demo.ol` which can be deployed by simply
typing the following command in the shell:
```
jolier demo.ol DEMO localhost:8000
```
The jolie rest service is working and it can be invoked at the url http://localhost:8000.

The template file used by jester for mappin the calls is the file `rest_templates.json`.
