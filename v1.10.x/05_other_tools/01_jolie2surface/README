To start the example, launch the following commands (in order) in separate shells.

- jolie printer.ol
- jolie fax.ol
- jolie aggregator.ol
- jolie client.ol

You will notice that the client.ol won't work because it is missing the AggregatorInterface.iol file.
Try to create the surface at the inputPort of the service aggregator launching the following command:

jolie2surface aggregator.ol Aggregator > AggregatorSurface.iol

Retry running the client.ol now!
